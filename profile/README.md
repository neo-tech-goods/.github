## Neo Tech Goods
This project consists of a proof of concept for a fictitious e-commerce company.
The goal is to document all aspects of the company, with a primary focus on its infrastructure.

### 🌟 Expectations
All source code will be made available in a public repository so that other people can study and use it as a reference for their own infrastructure projects. The entire development process will be documented in detail, from the conception of the idea to the final implementation and testing.
At the end of the proof of concept, it is expected to have a good and honest sample e-commerce application.

The project will provide a set of best practices and examples for the development of other similar applications.
